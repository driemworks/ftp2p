# State
Contains logic to build and manage the node state by applying transactions within blocks to the current state.

### The state
By the "state", we mean the end result of all transactions replayed on top of the genesis block (initial state).

#### Genesis Block
The genesis block defines the initial state of the system. 

#### Transactions
A transaction represents a unique, immutable event published by a node.
